🚀 CityKit v0.1 is live on GitHub — a reproducible toolkit for city corridor scenarios.

What it does: Generate zipped datasets with scenario configs, OpenStreetMap geometry, actor definitions, and stub videos. Run `make demo` and get a full output in ~30 seconds.

What it's NOT: A finished simulation engine. Videos are intentional placeholders. Trajectories are declared, not executed. Ground truth comes in v0.2.

Why we built it: Cities need better tools for testing ideas — curb zones, speed limits, delivery operations — *before* deployment. We wanted a foundation that's reproducible, honest about what's real, and welcoming to contributors.

Built in public. MIT licensed. Open data only (OSM + user captures; no Google Maps or proprietary sources).

Run it: github.com/urbanability-ai/citykit

See docs/READ_THIS_FIRST.md for the full story.

🚀 CityKit v0.1: Reproducible city corridor scenarios in 30 seconds. 

make demo → zipped dataset (map, config, stub videos, actors)

MIT. Open-source. Honest about what's placeholder.

CityKit v0.1 just shipped: a small, reproducible toolkit for generating city corridor scenarios.

Run `make demo` and get a zipped kit with:
- scenario config (schema v0.2)
- OpenStreetMap geometry
- actor definitions
- stub videos + KPI reports

Intentional placeholders: videos & metrics come in v0.2. The foundation is real.

Why? Cities need testbeds for operational ideas *before* deployment.

Built in public. MIT licensed. Open data only.

**CityKit v0.1 is out!**

📍 Live: github.com/urbanability-ai/citykit

Quick start: `make demo && make inspect`

What's included:
- Scenario schema (v0.2, OSM maps, actor rig)
- Stub video generation
- Example corridors & deltas

What's coming (v0.2):
- Real camera outputs
- Trajectory simulation
- Ground truth & metrics

Completely open-source (MIT). Feedback welcome.

## Notes

- Keep it honest: mention placeholders upfront. Don't oversell.
- Link to [READ_THIS_FIRST.md](READ_THIS_FIRST.md) for people who want detail.
- Mention "reproducible" and "open data" — these are differentiators.
- No fake metrics or hype. People will test it; be truthful.
