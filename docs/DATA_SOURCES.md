# Data Sources & Licensing

This document clarifies what data is allowed in the CityKit repo and why.

---

## ✅ Allowed Data Sources

### OpenStreetMap (OSM)

- **What:** Street networks, building footprints, POIs, etc.
- **License:** ODbL (Open Data Commons Open Database License)
- **Attribution required:** Yes. Include a note like: *"Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors"*
- **Usage in kit:** `scripts/demo.sh` can fetch OSM highways via Overpass API (MAP_MODE=osm)
- **Repo policy:** OK to commit small example GeoJSON features derived from OSM (with attribution)

### Open-Licensed Street Imagery

- **Mapillary:** CC BY-SA 4.0
- **KartaView (formerly OpenStreetCam):** CC BY-SA 4.0
- **Panoramax:** CC BY 4.0
- **User-captured stills:** Your own dashcam, phone, or GoPro footage
- **Attribution required:** Per license terms (usually yes)
- **Repo policy:** OK to commit small reference images or stills (document license in commit message). Store originals in `inputs/reference/` (gitignored).

### Synthetic & Placeholder Data

- **Simulator outputs:** Generated videos, point clouds, synthetic imagery
- **Stub/placeholder videos:** Text overlays, solid colors
- **Repo policy:** OK to commit (these are generated, not sourced)

---

## ❌ Not Allowed

### Google Maps / Google Street View

- **Why:** ToS prohibit scraping, bulk downloading, or republishing without explicit permission
- **Repo policy:** Do NOT commit screenshots, tiles, or Street View imagery

### Proprietary Map Services

- **Mapbox, Esri, HERE, TomTom, etc:**
- **Why:** Licensing typically prohibits republishing or derivative works without commercial agreement
- **Repo policy:** Do NOT commit tiles, extracts, or rendered maps from these services

### Unattributed or Scraped Imagery

- **Why:** License/source unknown; legal risk
- **Repo policy:** Do NOT commit without clear provenance

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

- **Faces, license plates, personal addresses in committed footage**
- **Why:** Privacy + regulatory concerns (GDPR, etc.)
- **Repo policy:** Do NOT commit. Blur or exclude before adding to git

## How to Add Reference Imagery

If you're testing with local captures or reference stills:

1. **Create** `inputs/reference/` (if not present)
2. **Place images there** (e.g., `inputs/reference/intersection_sunrise.jpg`)
3. **Update `.gitignore`** to exclude the folder
4. **Document the source** in a comment or sidecar file (e.g., `inputs/reference/README.md`)
5. **Do NOT commit** the actual images to git

Example:
```
inputs/reference/
├── README.md              # (committed; lists sources & licenses)
├── intersection_sunrise.jpg  # (gitignored)
└── my_test_footage.mp4    # (gitignored)
```

## Publishing Derived Datasets

If you create a public dataset based on this kit:

1. **Include provenance:** Document which source layers (OSM, user-captured, synthetic) are included
2. **Include licenses:** List the license of each component
3. **Attribute sources:** E.g., *"Street data © OpenStreetMap contributors, licensed ODbL; imagery: CC BY-SA 4.0"*
4. **Choose a compatible license:** If you mix data, ensure your license is compatible with all component licenses

Example provenance note:
```
"This dataset contains:
 - Street network: OpenStreetMap (© OSM contributors, ODbL)
 - Reference imagery: User-owned stills (CC BY 4.0)
 - Synthetic camera outputs: Generated by CityKit v0.2 (MIT)"
```

## Questions?

If you're unsure about a data source:

1. Check the source's license file or terms
2. Ask in an issue or PR
3. When in doubt, document the source and license explicitly

We want the repo to be useful and legally clean. Transparency helps us get there.
